# EPFLx-scala-reactiveX
Reactive programming is a set of techniques for implementing scalable, resilient and responsive systems. The basic building-block of such systems is event handlers. This course teaches how to implement reactive systems in Scala by using high-level abstractions based on event-handlers.

There are seven chapters and assignments for each chapter. 
  1. Introduction, Recap and Asynchronous Programming
  2. The Actor Model
  3. Handling Failure and State
  4. Distributed Computing
  5. Typed Actors
  6. Stream Processing
  7. Advanced Stream Processing

Basically this repository contains seven projects and each project can be complied and tested with the sbt command.
